Publish A Small Template Project
################################

Once the small project owner finished the projects form and save his edits
she / he could submit his project for publication.

The small project owner could do this within the menubar on the left side.
She / he had to click on the menu entry 'Private' and than click on the entry
'Submit for publication' in the opening drop down menu. The menu entry
will change from 'Private' to 'Pending'.

The small project owner will get an email with an information about this
workflow change. A corresponding email will be send to the administrator or
a configured email address for this task (configured inside the
'Template Center'.

The small template project has been forwarded into the review queue of
the 'Template Center' / Plone site.
Once the administrator, site-admiministrator or a reviewer changed the
workflow state again, e.g. published the project, the small project owner
will get a further email with this new state.
